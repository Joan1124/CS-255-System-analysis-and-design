In this driverPass project, my client Liam, wanted to develop a system to assist students to train to help them ace their driving test. The system is a web application running on the cloud.

Something I did particularly well in this project was identifying the user's needs and technincal requirements.
If I were to improve anything from my design I would improve, my use case diagram. I would add a few more actors and some use cases that could improve the design. 
Interpreting the user needs is a crucial step in the design process, because any misinterpretaion could lead to an incomplete system or a completely erroneous one. I interpreted them by carefully reading through the user's chat transcripts. 

In the future I will use every technique I learned in this course such as creating use case diagrams, activity diagrams, requirements documents, etc. Honestly I used to not be a fan of the designing process, but I see it can definitely not be overlooked
